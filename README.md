# FreebaseViz
Freebase Schema Visualiser
A web-based visualisation tool, named FreebaseViz, for visually exploring the schema of Freebase. 
The visualisation design is built upon node-link network layouts, which can facilitate exploring connectivity, visual search and analysis, and visualising patterns underlying the schema graph. 
FreebaseViz allows users to interact with the schema visualisations to filter and drill into lower levels of detail, and highlight subsets of the schema graph.

The FreebaseViz tool is explained in detail through the published paper below:
